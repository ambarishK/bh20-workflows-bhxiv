# Workflows : SOPs + WDL + CWL + GALAXY
### Standard Operating Protocols - GATK4, VARSCAN and SAMTools.
Added SOPs are for genomic variant discovery using GATK4, VARSCAN and SAMTools.

###### Execution of GATK4 WDL script


### GALAXY workflows for assembly and downstream analysis
#### Assembly and downstream analysis
There are two workflows for assembly and downstream analysis - denovo and reference based. Apart, three workflows are for genomic variant discoveries - GATK, VARSCAN and SAMTools.
